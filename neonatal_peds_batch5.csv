"Neonatal & Pediatrics","neonatal-peds","Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn","hard","interpretation","high","A term newborn has severe hypoxemia that does not improve with 100 percent oxygen. Preductal saturation is significantly higher than postductal saturation. What condition is most likely?","Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn","Respiratory distress syndrome","Transient tachypnea of the newborn","Mild pneumonia","A","Preductal and postductal saturation difference with refractory hypoxemia suggests right-to-left shunting from PPHN.","A: Correct because shunting through ductus arteriosus causes differential saturation. | B: RDS does not cause differential pre/postductal saturations. | C: TTN is usually mild and improves with oxygen. | D: Pneumonia does not cause classic differential cyanosis pattern.","preductal vs postductal | refractory hypoxemia","Ignoring differential saturation clue.","Think shunt when oxygen does not improve PaO2.","pass"
"Neonatal & Pediatrics","neonatal-peds","Neonatal surfactant deficiency","medium","interpretation","high","A 28-week premature infant develops grunting, nasal flaring, and diffuse ground-glass infiltrates on chest radiograph. What is the primary underlying problem?","Surfactant deficiency","Pulmonary embolism","Cardiac failure","Upper airway obstruction","A","Premature infants commonly lack sufficient surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse and RDS.","A: Classic RDS findings. | B-D: Not consistent with prematurity and diffuse pattern.","premature | ground-glass | grunting","Missing classic RDS presentation.","Prematurity + diffuse atelectasis = surfactant deficiency.","pass"
"Neonatal & Pediatrics","neonatal-peds","Pediatric asthma severity indicator","medium","interpretation","moderate","A 6-year-old with asthma has decreased wheezing but worsening fatigue and reduced air movement. What does this most likely indicate?","Impending respiratory failure","Clinical improvement","Mild exacerbation","Psychological distress","A","Decreased wheezing with poor air movement may indicate severe obstruction and fatigue.","A: Correct because silent chest suggests severe airflow limitation. | B: True improvement would show improved aeration. | C: Mild cases do not show fatigue. | D: Symptoms are physiologic.","reduced breath sounds | fatigue","Thinking less wheeze equals improvement.","Silent chest = danger sign.","pass"
"Neonatal & Pediatrics","neonatal-peds","Apnea of prematurity treatment","medium","decision-making","moderate","A 30-week premature infant has recurrent apnea episodes without infection.

Chest radiograph shows hyperinflation on one side. What is the next best step?","Rigid bronchoscopy","Nebulized bronchodilator","Chest physiotherapy","Discharge home","A","Unilateral hyperinflation after choking suggests foreign body requiring bronchoscopy.","A: Definitive diagnostic and therapeutic step. | B: May delay necessary removal. | C: Not appropriate for obstruction. | D: Unsafe.","unilateral wheeze | hyperinflation | sudden onset","Treating as asthma without history consideration.","Sudden onset + asymmetry = foreign body.","pass"
