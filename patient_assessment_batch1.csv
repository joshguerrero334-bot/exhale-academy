Breath sounds are diminished bilaterally. What does this most likely indicate?","Early respiratory distress","Stable condition","Sedation overdose","Primary metabolic acidosis","A","Tachypnea, mild hypoxemia, and accessory muscle use indicate early respiratory compromise.","A: Correct. | B: Findings are abnormal. | C: No bradypnea or decreased LOC. | D: No acid-base data provided.","RR 28 | accessory muscles | early","Waiting for severe signs before intervening.","Identify distress early before failure.","pass"
