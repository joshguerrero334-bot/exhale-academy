"Mechanical Ventilation","mechanical-ventilation","High pressure alarm troubleshooting","medium","decision-making","high","A ventilated patient suddenly triggers a high peak pressure alarm. Plateau pressure is unchanged from baseline. What is the most likely cause?","Bronchospasm or secretion obstruction","Worsening ARDS","Pneumothorax","Decreased lung compliance","A","Elevated peak with stable plateau indicates increased airway resistance rather than compliance change.","A: Correct because resistance raises peak but not plateau. | B: ARDS increases plateau. | C: Pneumothorax usually increases plateau. | D: Compliance problems elevate both peak and plateau.","peak high | plateau unchanged","Ignoring plateau comparison.","Always compare peak vs plateau.","pass"
