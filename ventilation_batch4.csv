"Ventilation","Elevated peak pressure with normal plateau","medium","interpretation","high","A ventilated patient develops an increase in peak inspiratory pressure from 28 to 42 cm H2O. Plateau pressure remains 24 cm H2O. What is the most likely cause?","Decreased lung compliance","Bronchospasm or increased airway resistance","Pneumothorax","Pulmonary edema","B","An increase in peak pressure with unchanged plateau pressure indicates increased airway resistance rather than decreased compliance.","A: Would increase both peak and plateau. | B: Correct because only peak rises with resistance issues. | C: Typically raises plateau pressure. | D: Decreases compliance and raises plateau.","peak high | plateau unchanged","Confusing resistance with compliance.","Peak–plateau difference reflects airway resistance.","single best answer: yes; physiology accurate: yes; no repeat: yes"
"Ventilation","Elevated peak and plateau pressures","medium","interpretation","high","Peak inspiratory pressure rises from 25 to 40 cm H2O and plateau pressure rises from 22 to 38 cm H2O.
