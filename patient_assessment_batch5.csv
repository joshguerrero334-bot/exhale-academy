"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Respiratory pattern recognition - Cheyne-Stokes","medium","interpretation","moderate","A patient with a history of heart failure demonstrates cyclic waxing and waning respirations followed by brief apnea. What breathing pattern is this?","Cheyne-Stokes respiration","Biot respiration","Kussmaul respiration","Apneustic breathing","A","Cheyne-Stokes is characterized by crescendo-decrescendo breathing alternating with apnea, commonly seen in CHF or neurologic injury.","A: Correct cyclic pattern. | B: Biot is irregular with unpredictable apnea. | C: Kussmaul is deep and rapid without cyclic apnea. | D: Apneustic involves prolonged inspiratory pauses.","waxing and waning | apnea","Confusing cyclic pattern with irregular breathing.","Pattern recognition is high-yield.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Kussmaul breathing significance","medium","interpretation","high","A patient with diabetic ketoacidosis is breathing rapidly and deeply with a consistent pattern. What is the primary physiologic purpose of this breathing pattern?","Compensate for metabolic acidosis","Increase oxygen consumption","Indicate airway obstruction","Reduce cardiac preload","A","Kussmaul respirations help lower PaCO2 to compensate for metabolic acidosis.","A: Correct compensation. | B: Not oxygen driven. | C: Obstruction causes labored breathing but not this pattern. | D: Not primary goal.","DKA | deep rapid breathing","Calling it respiratory distress only.","Compensatory hyperventilation lowers CO2.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Work of breathing escalation sign","hard","decision-making","high","A patient with severe asthma initially tachypneic becomes quiet with minimal air movement and decreasing wheezing. What does this most strongly suggest?","Impending respiratory failure","Clinical improvement","Bronchodilator success","Normal fatigue recovery","A","Decreasing wheeze with poor air movement suggests severe obstruction and fatigue, not improvement.","A: Correct life-threatening sign. | B: Quiet chest is ominous. | C: Bronchodilation increases airflow and wheezing initially. | D: Fatigue here indicates decompensation.","quiet chest | severe asthma","Thinking less wheeze means improvement.","Silent chest = severe obstruction.","pass"

What is this symptom called?","Orthopnea","Platypnea","Trepopnea","Dyspnea on exertion","A","Orthopnea describes dyspnea in the supine position, often due to heart failure.","A: Correct definition. | B: Platypnea is dyspnea when upright. | C: Trepopnea occurs in one lateral position. | D: Exertional dyspnea unrelated to position.","lying flat worsens","Confusing positional terms.","Know positional dyspnea terminology.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Use of pulse pressure in shock","hard","interpretation","high","A trauma patient has BP 100/90 mm Hg with tachycardia and cool skin.
