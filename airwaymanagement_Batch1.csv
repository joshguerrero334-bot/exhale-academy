Which condition is most consistent with these findings?","Upper airway obstruction","Lower airway bronchospasm","Pulmonary edema","Metabolic acidosis","A","Inspiratory stridor and suprasternal retractions are classic signs of upper airway obstruction.","A: Correct because stridor indicates upper airway narrowing. | B: Bronchospasm causes expiratory wheezing not stridor. | C: Pulmonary edema causes crackles not stridor. | D: Metabolic acidosis does not cause stridor.","stridor | suprasternal retractions | inspiratory","Confusing wheezing with stridor.","Differentiate upper vs lower airway sounds.","pass"
