# CSE Style Spec v1 - Trauma Pilot Compliance

This file shows how Adult Trauma (cases 16-19) was aligned to `cse_style_spec_v1.md`.

## Files updated
- `/Users/joshguerrero/exhale-academy/docs/cse_case16_17_trauma_critical_insert.sql`
- `/Users/joshguerrero/exhale-academy/docs/cse_case18_19_trauma_critical_insert.sql`

## Applied changes

1. Priority prompt language
- DM prompts updated to include `FIRST` and `NEXT` wording.
- This mirrors exam-style sequencing pressure.

2. Explicit timeline checkpoints
- Reassessment IG prompts now include explicit elapsed time:
  - `Ten minutes after...`
  - `Fifteen minutes after...`
  - `Thirty minutes after...`

3. Coherent escalation wording
- Final DM steps now explicitly ask for `NEXT` management/disposition.
- Reduces ambiguity in branch progression.

4. Diagnosis-leading phrasing removed
- Objective finding language used instead of direct label signaling in reveal text.

## Current status
- Trauma pilot now matches style-spec intent for:
  - scenario framing
  - sequencing language
  - temporal progression
  - escalation clarity

## Next recommended pass (same category)
- Reduce IG option count from 8 to 5-6 where possible for tighter discrimination.
- Add standardized acknowledgment lines (`Noted`, `Physician agrees`, `Make another selection`) in event text pipeline.
- Tighten rationale length to one concise physiologic sentence each.
