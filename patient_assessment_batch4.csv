"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Accessory muscle use interpretation","medium","interpretation","high","A patient with acute respiratory distress demonstrates sternocleidomastoid and intercostal muscle use during inspiration. What does this most strongly indicate?","Increased work of breathing","Normal respiratory pattern","Primary metabolic disorder","Improved lung compliance","A","Accessory muscle recruitment reflects increased inspiratory effort and elevated work of breathing.","A: Correct — accessory muscles activate when primary respiratory muscles are insufficient. | B: This is not normal at rest. | C: Metabolic disorders do not directly cause accessory use. | D: Improved compliance would reduce effort.","sternocleidomastoid use | distress","Underestimating visible effort.","Accessory muscle use = increased work of breathing.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Tripod positioning significance","medium","interpretation","moderate","A patient with COPD sits leaning forward with arms braced on a table while breathing. What is the physiologic purpose of this posture?","Improves diaphragmatic efficiency","Reduces cardiac output","Increases airway resistance","Indicates neurologic deficit","A","The tripod position stabilizes shoulder girdle muscles to enhance accessory muscle function and improve diaphragmatic mechanics.","A: Correct — posture optimizes ventilatory mechanics. | B: Not primary goal. | C: Does not intentionally increase resistance. | D: Not neurologic in origin.","leaning forward | arms braced","Assuming it is simply comfort behavior.","Positioning can improve mechanics.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Early shock respiratory response","medium","interpretation","high","A trauma patient has normal blood pressure but increasing respiratory rate to 32/min and cool extremities. What is the most likely explanation?","Compensatory response to early shock","Primary anxiety","Improved oxygen delivery","Sedation effect","A","Tachypnea and peripheral vasoconstriction may precede hypotension in early shock states.","A: Correct early compensation. | B: Anxiety does not explain cool extremities. | C: Oxygen delivery likely reduced. | D: Sedation depresses respiratory rate.","normal BP | tachypnea | cool extremities","Waiting for hypotension before recognizing shock.","Shock can exist before BP falls.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Paradoxical breathing recognition","hard","interpretation","high","A patient with chest trauma demonstrates inward movement of a chest wall segment during inspiration. What does this finding indicate?","Flail chest","Normal respiratory variation","Diaphragmatic paralysis","Bronchospasm","A","Paradoxical inward motion of a segment during inspiration is classic for flail chest.","A: Correct traumatic instability. | B: Not normal. | C: Diaphragm dysfunction affects abdominal movement. | D: Bronchospasm does not cause chest wall paradox.","inward segment movement","Missing visual diagnostic clues.","Paradoxical motion = structural instability.","pass"
"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Mental status and hypercapnia","hard","interpretation","high","A patient becomes progressively somnolent with shallow breathing. ABG reveals PaCO2 72 mm Hg.

"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Delayed capillary refill interpretation","medium","interpretation","moderate","Capillary refill time exceeds 4 seconds in a hypotensive patient. What does this most suggest?","Peripheral hypoperfusion","Normal aging response","Improved circulation","Bronchospasm","A","Delayed refill reflects decreased peripheral perfusion.","A: Correct indicator. | B: Aging does not prolong refill this significantly. | C: Opposite finding. | D: Not airway related.","cap refill >4 sec","Ignoring peripheral circulation signs.","Peripheral perfusion is key shock marker.","pass"
