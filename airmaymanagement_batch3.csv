"Airway Management","airway-management","Cuff leak test interpretation","hard","interpretation","high","A patient is being evaluated for extubation. The cuff leak test reveals no audible leak after cuff deflation. What is the most likely concern?","Laryngeal edema and risk of post-extubation stridor","Bronchospasm","Pulmonary embolism","Equipment malfunction","A","Absence of cuff leak suggests airway edema and increased risk of stridor after extubation.","A: Correct because no leak implies upper airway narrowing. | B: Bronchospasm affects lower airway and would not affect cuff leak. | C: PE does not affect upper airway patency. | D: Equipment issue unlikely if properly tested.","no cuff leak | extubation evaluation","Ignoring airway swelling risk.","Cuff leak absence = suspect upper airway edema.","pass"
"Airway Management","airway-management","High peak pressure after intubation","hard","interpretation","high","Immediately after intubation, peak inspiratory pressure rises significantly while plateau pressure remains normal. What is the most likely cause?","Increased airway resistance such as bronchospasm","Decreased lung compliance","Tension pneumothorax","Pulmonary edema","A","High peak with normal plateau suggests airway resistance problem rather than compliance issue.","A: Correct because resistance affects peak but not plateau. | B: Compliance issues raise both peak and plateau. | C: Pneumothorax typically raises plateau as well. | D: Pulmonary edema affects compliance.","peak high | plateau normal","Confusing compliance with resistance.","Differentiate peak vs plateau to localize problem.","pass"

What is the most appropriate initial treatment?","Administer racemic epinephrine nebulization","Immediate re-intubation","Increase tidal volume","Administer diuretics","A","Racemic epinephrine reduces airway edema and is first-line for mild post-extubation stridor.","A: Correct because it decreases mucosal swelling. | B: Re-intubation reserved for severe compromise. | C: Tidal volume irrelevant. | D: Diuretics do not treat laryngeal edema.","mild stridor | post-extubation","Overreacting with immediate re-intubation.","Treat edema medically before invasive action.","pass"

What physiologic factor contributes most to this rapid desaturation?","Reduced functional residual capacity","Increased hemoglobin affinity","Decreased metabolic rate","Excess dead space ventilation","A","Obesity reduces FRC, leading to rapid oxygen reserve depletion during apnea.","A: Correct because lower FRC shortens safe apnea time. | B: Hemoglobin affinity not primary factor. | C: Metabolic rate does not decrease significantly. | D: Dead space not primary cause of rapid desaturation.","obese | rapid desaturation | apnea","Ignoring FRC physiology.","Lower FRC = shorter safe apnea time.","pass"

What is the immediate action?","Provide bag-mask ventilation and prepare for re-intubation","Increase ventilator rate","Administer bronchodilator","Obtain arterial blood gas first","A","Apneic patient requires immediate manual ventilation and airway control.","A: Correct because airway and ventilation take priority. | B: Ventilator disconnected. | C: Bronchodilator inappropriate. | D: ABG delays critical action.","self-extubation | apnea","Ordering tests before stabilizing airway.","Airway first, diagnostics later.","pass"

What is the most likely cause?","Circuit disconnect or leak","Bronchospasm","Increased compliance","Pulmonary fibrosis","A","Low-pressure alarms commonly indicate circuit disconnection.","A: Correct because loss of pressure indicates leak. | B: Bronchospasm increases pressure. | C: Compliance changes do not cause disconnect alarm. | D: Fibrosis increases pressure.","low-pressure alarm | desaturation","Treating patient before checking circuit.","Always check equipment first.","pass"

What is the most appropriate immediate intervention?","Perform needle decompression","Increase FiO2","Administer diuretics","Decrease PEEP","A","Findings strongly suggest tension pneumothorax requiring immediate decompression.","A: Correct life-saving intervention. | B: Oxygen alone insufficient. | C: Diuretics inappropriate. | D: Vent adjustments do not treat cause.","hypotension | tracheal deviation | unilateral absent sounds","Adjusting ventilator instead of decompressing.","Treat tension pneumothorax immediately.","pass"
