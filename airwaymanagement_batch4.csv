"Airway Management","airway-management","Unilateral breath sounds after intubation","medium","decision-making","high","Immediately after intubation, breath sounds are absent on the left but present on the right. Oxygen saturation is stable. What is the most likely cause?","Right mainstem intubation","Left pneumothorax","Severe bronchospasm","Esophageal intubation","A","The right main bronchus is more vertical, making right mainstem intubation the most common cause of unilateral breath sounds.","A: Correct because ETT often advances into right mainstem. | B: Pneumothorax usually presents with instability or rising pressures. | C: Bronchospasm causes bilateral wheezing. | D: Esophageal intubation would cause absent bilateral breath sounds and poor oxygenation.","absent left sounds | post-intubation","Jumping to pneumothorax before checking tube depth.","After intubation, always suspect mainstem first.","pass"
