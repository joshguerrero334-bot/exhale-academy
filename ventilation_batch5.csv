"Ventilation","Prioritizing ventilation vs oxygenation","hard","decision-making","high","An intubated patient has SpO2 96 percent on FiO2 0.60. ABG shows pH 7.22, PaCO2 68 mm Hg, PaO2 110 mm Hg. What is the most appropriate ventilator adjustment?","Increase FiO2 to 1.0","Increase minute ventilation","Decrease PEEP","Administer diuretic","B","Oxygenation is adequate. The primary problem is respiratory acidosis from hypercapnia, requiring increased minute ventilation.","A: Oxygenation already sufficient. | B: Correct because CO2 clearance is inadequate. | C: PEEP not causing hypercapnia here. | D: No evidence of fluid overload.","PaO2 110 | pH 7.22 | PaCO2 68","Fixating on FiO2 despite normal oxygenation.","Match intervention to the dominant physiologic failure.","single best answer: yes; trap present: oxygen distraction; no repeat: yes"

What adjustment is most appropriate?","Increase respiratory rate","Decrease minute ventilation","Increase PEEP","Increase FiO2","B","The patient is alkalotic from excessive ventilation. Reducing minute ventilation corrects hypocapnia.","A: Would worsen alkalosis. | B: Correct to normalize CO2. | C: PEEP does not address CO2. | D: Oxygenation adequate.","pH 7.55 | PaCO2 25","Treating normal oxygenation instead of ventilation issue.","Correct the variable that is abnormal.","single best answer: yes; trap present: oxygen distraction; no repeat: yes"

What should be done first?","Increase FiO2","Withdraw the endotracheal tube slightly","Administer bronchodilator","Order chest x-ray","B","Likely right mainstem intubation. Withdrawing the tube slightly restores bilateral ventilation.","A: Does not fix unilateral ventilation. | B: Correct immediate correction. | C: Not bronchospasm pattern. | D: Imaging delays correction.","after intubation | absent breath sounds one side","Ordering imaging before correcting likely mainstem.","Fix simple mechanical causes first.","single best answer: yes; trap present: diagnostic delay; no repeat: yes"

"Ventilation","Dead space vs shunt confusion","hard","interpretation","high","A patient has rising PaCO2 despite increasing respiratory rate. PaO2 remains stable. What is the most likely cause?","Increased dead space ventilation","Increased shunt fraction","Low FiO2","Hypoxic drive suppression","A","Dead space reduces effective alveolar ventilation, so CO2 rises despite higher rate.","A: Correct. | B: Shunt affects oxygenation primarily. | C: Oxygenation not falling. | D: Not relevant in ventilated patient.","rising CO2 | stable oxygen","Confusing oxygen and CO2 physiology.","Dead space primarily impacts CO2 elimination.","single best answer: yes; trap present: shunt confusion; no repeat: yes"
"Ventilation","RSBI trap interpretation","hard","interpretation","moderate","A patient has RR 28 and tidal volume 320 mL during spontaneous breathing trial. What is the correct interpretation?","RSBI 8.9 indicates success","RSBI 89 indicates likely success","RSBI 112 indicates failure","RSBI 280 indicates failure","B","RSBI = 28 / 0.32 = 87.5, which predicts likely weaning success.","A: Calculation incorrect. | B: Correct value and interpretation. | C: Incorrect math. | D: Incorrect math.","convert mL to liters","Forgetting to convert mL to liters.","Math errors are common board traps.","single best answer: yes; trap present: unit conversion; no repeat: yes"
"Ventilation","Auto-PEEP mismanagement trap","hard","decision-making","high","A patient with asthma has worsening hypercapnia and high peak pressures. Flow does not return to baseline. What change would worsen the condition?","Decrease respiratory rate","Decrease tidal volume","Increase respiratory rate","Increase expiratory time","C","Increasing respiratory rate shortens expiratory time and worsens air trapping.","A: Helpful. | B: Helpful. | C: Correct because worsens hyperinflation. | D: Helpful.","flow not baseline | asthma","Increasing rate in obstructive disease.","More rate = less expiratory time.","single best answer: yes; trap present: intuitive but wrong; no repeat: yes"
