"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Pulsus paradoxus recognition","hard","interpretation","high","A patient in severe respiratory distress has systolic blood pressure that decreases by 18 mm Hg during inspiration. What does this finding most suggest?","Severe airway obstruction","Normal physiologic variation","Systemic hypertension","Metabolic alkalosis","A","A drop greater than 10 mm Hg in systolic pressure during inspiration defines pulsus paradoxus, commonly seen in severe obstructive lung disease.","A: Correct — severe obstruction increases intrathoracic pressure swings. | B: Normal variation is less than 10 mm Hg. | C: Hypertension does not cause this pattern. | D: Acid-base disorders do not create this sign.","18 mm Hg drop | during inspiration","Not knowing threshold for pulsus paradoxus.","Quantify physiologic definitions precisely.","pass"

"Patient Assessment","patient-assessment","Silent chest interpretation","hard","interpretation","high","An asthmatic patient has minimal air movement with almost absent wheezing and increasing drowsiness. What does this indicate?","Impending respiratory failure","Resolution of bronchospasm","Anxiety attack","Equipment malfunction","A","A silent chest in severe asthma indicates minimal airflow and high risk of arrest.","A: Correct life-threatening sign. | B: Improvement would increase airflow. | C: Anxiety does not eliminate breath sounds. | D: No device referenced.","minimal air movement | drowsy","Thinking less wheeze means improvement.","Less wheeze can mean less airflow.","pass"

What is the most likely cause of tachycardia?","Compensatory sympathetic response","Primary cardiac arrhythmia","Sedation overdose","Improved oxygenation","A","Hypoxemia stimulates sympathetic activation leading to tachycardia.","A: Correct physiologic response. | B: No arrhythmia described. | C: Sedation lowers HR. | D: Oxygenation is low not improved.","HR 128 | hypoxemia","Overcomplicating simple compensation.","Sympathetic compensation is common.","pass"
