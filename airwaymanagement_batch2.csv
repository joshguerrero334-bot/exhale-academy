What is the most likely problem?","Esophageal intubation","Right mainstem intubation","Bronchospasm","Tension pneumothorax","A","Absent CO2 waveform with abdominal distention strongly indicates esophageal intubation.","A: Correct because lack of CO2 confirms non-tracheal placement. | B: Mainstem intubation still produces CO2 waveform. | C: Bronchospasm does not eliminate CO2 waveform. | D: Pneumothorax does not abolish capnography immediately.","no waveform | abdominal distention | immediate post-intubation","Relying on breath sounds alone.","Capnography absence = remove tube immediately.","pass"

Capnography is present. What is the most likely cause?","Right mainstem bronchus intubation","Esophageal intubation","Pulmonary edema","Equipment failure","A","Right mainstem intubation causes unilateral breath sounds while capnography remains present.","A: Correct because tube likely advanced too far. | B: Esophageal intubation would show no CO2 waveform. | C: Pulmonary edema causes bilateral findings. | D: Equipment failure would not cause unilateral sounds.","unilateral breath sounds | CO2 present","Pulling tube completely instead of adjusting depth.","If CO2 present + unilateral sounds = pull back slightly.","pass"

"Airway Management","airway-management","Cuff pressure management","hard","decision-making","high","An intubated patient has a cuff pressure measured at 40 cm H2O. What is the most appropriate action?","Reduce cuff pressure to 20–30 cm H2O range","Increase cuff pressure to prevent leak","Deflate cuff completely","Replace the tube immediately","A","Optimal cuff pressure is typically 20–30 cm H2O to prevent mucosal ischemia.","A: Correct to prevent tracheal injury. | B: Higher pressures risk mucosal damage. | C: Full deflation risks aspiration. | D: Tube replacement unnecessary.","40 cm H2O | cuff pressure","Ignoring tracheal injury risk.","Maintain safe cuff range.","pass"

"Airway Management","airway-management","Bag-mask ventilation failure cause","hard","interpretation","high","During bag-mask ventilation, chest rise is minimal despite proper mask seal. The patient has a large beard. What is the most likely cause?","Poor mask seal due to facial hair","Severe metabolic acidosis","Hyperkalemia","Excess oxygen flow","A","Facial hair commonly prevents adequate mask seal.","A: Correct because air leak reduces ventilation. | B: Metabolic acidosis does not impair seal. | C: Hyperkalemia unrelated. | D: Oxygen flow not the primary issue.","large beard | minimal chest rise","Increasing pressure instead of fixing seal.","Seal first before increasing force.","pass"
"Airway Management","airway-management","Airway edema recognition","medium","interpretation","moderate","A recently extubated patient develops inspiratory stridor and hoarseness. What is the most likely cause?","Laryngeal edema","Bronchospasm","Pulmonary embolism","Atelectasis","A","Post-extubation stridor suggests laryngeal edema.","A: Correct because airway swelling narrows glottic opening. | B: Bronchospasm produces expiratory wheezing. | C: PE causes hypoxemia not stridor. | D: Atelectasis causes crackles.","post-extubation | stridor","Treating with bronchodilators only.","Recognize upper airway edema.","pass"
